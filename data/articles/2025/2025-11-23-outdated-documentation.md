Documentation in Software Engineering outdates quickly as processes and technologies evolve.
Teams struggle to keep documentation current which could lead to confusion when looked at later.
Onboarding new team members becomes challenging too as they are up-skilled on outdated information.

Outdated documentation is not necessarily the worst thing to have as it still tells a story and is the legacy of change.
However, it can become dangerous when it's deemed a source of truth and decisions need to be based on it.

Living documentation means that it is actively maintained and updated to reflect the current state of the system, processes, and technologies.
It should not be the sole responsibility of one person in a team, rather a collective effort
for everyone to benefit from.

Documentation should be free from ambiguity, should be easy to understand and technical jargon should be clearly defined and explained
so that domain concepts can easily be understood and grasped by anyone.

## Centralize it

Disparate documentation scattered across various platforms and formats makes it hard to find and update.

Centralize your documentation. One way is to create a simple markdown documentation repository that is the single entry point for all important information so that you
don't have to curate content and stash them in various places online. This reduces the cognitive load of finding and updating documentation.
It also reduces the barrier to entry for team members to contribute to documentation upkeep.
It's searchable in your editor and when information is found, it is easy to update.

Your repository can be hosted as a browseable content website that is editable on a version control system and online tool like GitHub that can be used by any stakeholder of the system. Frameworks like Docusaurus, MkDocs, or GitBook can help you set this up quickly.

Whats more is that your diagrams can be created using something like mermaid that generates diagrams from text and is rendered by your hosting platform without the need of creating images from scratch that are hard to update later on.

## Secure it

Ensure that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized people so that you don't expose information you should not be sharing. Your documentation repository should contain enough information to get people going, up to speed and productive. Don't document sensitive information like passwords, secret keys, or any information that could lead to a security breach. Rather indicate how to access such information through secure channels.

## Communicate it

When you come across outdated documentation, communicate it to the team so that someone else doesn't update it at the same time as you do to mitigate duplication of work.

Open communication channels encourage team members to drive a conversation prior to making changes so that the changes incorporated include everyone's perspective.

## Own it

It is critical to keep documentation high on the list when introducing change to the system.
When you take on a new task, ask yourself how the system is changing and what effects it has on the currently documented processes and systems.
Ensure that documentation upkeep is part of the definition of done for every task.

## Review it

Documentation should be the team bible.
Ensure documentation is reviewed regularly.
When a change is introduced and the documentation is updated as part of a task, ensure that the team reviews the code and updated content that is relevant and vetted for correctness.
This also creates the opportunity to share knowledge about change and reduce ambiguity and misunderstandings based on additional perspectives.

Set a recurring calendar reminder to review documentation every quarter or bi-annually.
Encourage team members to flag and update outdated documentation when they come across it.

## Automate it

With the rise of AI tools, leverage them to help identify outdated documentation.
Some tools can scan documentation and codebases and highlight sections that may be out of date based on recent changes in codebase or processes.

You can also get system diagrams generated automatically from codebases to ensure they are always up to date.

## Use it

Eat your own dog food. If you entrust someone else to use the documentation then you should use it too.
Before performing a task, refer to the documentation to ensure you are following the documented processes.

Encourage team members to refer to documentation when performing tasks.
When documentation is actively used, it is more likely to be kept current.

## Outsource it

When new people join the team, they can use this documentation to get up to speed.
Assign them the task of reviewing and updating documentation as part of their onboarding process.
Encourage questions and feedback from new team members to identify areas where documentation may be lacking, outdated or downright confusing.
Give them the opportunity to improve on the documentation when something doesn't make sense to them.

## Conclusion

Documentation is a living entity that requires attention and care.
By centralizing, securing, communicating, owning, reviewing, automating, using and, outsourcing documentation upkeep, teams can ensure that their documentation remains relevant and useful. This makes for easier onboarding, smoother processes, and improved accuracy in work.

This not only improves productivity but also enhances collaboration and knowledge sharing within the team.
