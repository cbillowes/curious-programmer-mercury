I’ve been on both sides of the interview table. As a candidate, I’ve walked into rooms (real or virtual) with my heart racing, wondering if I’d remember how to reverse a linked list under pressure. As an interviewer, I’ve read through job specs so ambitious they could only be filled by a team of superheroes. In both roles, I’ve walked away with the same thought: this system isn’t working as well as it should.

## The gap between the job spec and reality

One of the first cracks shows up in the job description. I’ve seen postings that ask for mastery in five different programming languages, experience in cloud platforms, database tuning, front-end design, and leadership skills—all rolled into one.

When I was a candidate, I felt the pressure to stretch my resume, to emphasize every side project and inflate every bullet point. When I was an interviewer, I found myself disappointed when no one matched the picture we’d painted. That’s the problem—neither side was being dishonest. The problem was the description itself.

## The stress of performance

Then comes the interview itself. For candidates, being asked to solve an algorithm puzzle on a whiteboard feels like standing on stage with a spotlight overhead. It doesn’t matter how well you know your craft in day-to-day life—your hands sweat, your mind blanks, and suddenly you’re questioning everything.

As an interviewer, I’ve realized that what I actually care about isn’t whether someone can solve a puzzle in 20 minutes. I care about how they think, how they collaborate, and whether they can approach messy, real-world problems with creativity and patience. But the way we’ve designed interviews doesn’t always give us that information.

## Responsibilities that don’t line up

Even when we’ve hired, expectations can still feel off. I’ve seen junior engineers thrown into roles that expected them to manage entire systems. I’ve seen seniors asked to deliver at speeds that weren’t sustainable. And I’ve watched candidates join teams without really understanding what kind of work they were stepping into.

The mismatch leaves everyone frustrated. Not because people aren’t capable, but because the expectations weren’t aligned from the start.

## The purpose we sometimes forget

When we strip away the jargon and the anxiety, the purpose of hiring is straightforward. A new position exists because the team needs help. Maybe a system needs stability, maybe features need to ship faster, maybe a fresh perspective is missing. That’s it.

Remembering this brings clarity. It’s not about perfection. It’s about finding the right person to join in solving real problems.

## What helps on both sides

As an interviewer, I’ve learned to ask myself: what are the real challenges of this role? Then I try to design conversations around those. Debugging a piece of code together, talking through how they’d approach a new feature, or hearing about a time they worked through something hard—these give me much more insight than puzzles ever could.

As a candidate, I’ve learned to present myself as I am, not as who I think the job spec wants me to be. I’ve also learned to ask questions—what is the biggest challenge the team is facing? What does success in the first six months look like? The answers reveal more than any glossy job description.

## A more human process

Interviews will always carry some nerves—work is important, and these decisions matter. But when both sides show up with honesty and curiosity, the process changes. It becomes less about performance and more about partnership.

That’s the kind of interview I hope we move toward. One where the candidate and the company both leave the conversation feeling like they’ve learned something real. One where clarity, empathy, and respect take the place of anxiety. One where we remember the goal isn’t to pass a test—it’s to find the right person to solve problems together.
