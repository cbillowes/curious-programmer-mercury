I've migrated my blog from Gatsby to Next.js.
I find Next.js to be a great framework that is easy to use, and powerful to extend.
It might not be the most ideal approach for blogs but the migration was seamless and I am very happy with the result.
This course gives you step-by-step instructions on how to do the same.

## Objectives

:tada: At the end of this course you should be able to:

- Create a new blog in Next.js.
- Write content in Markdown with embedded components.
- Style your blog with Flowbite.
- Set up authentication with Stack Auth.
- Set up a database with Neon.
- Create a sitemap.
- Enable search functionality with Algolia.
- Deploy your blog to Netlify.
