Congratulations!
You have built a fully functional Next.js blog with features like authentication, likes, a progress bar, SEO optimizations, and search functionality.
What a ride :car: it's been :smile:

- Don't forget to go to <https://app.stack-auth.com> to upgrade your Stack Auth project to production.
- Add a custom domain name to your blog on Netlify, if you have one.

If you have any questions, need help, or know of improvements I can make to this course, please create a pull request or open an issue on the [course repository](https://github.com/cbillowes/curious-programmer-mercury/issues).

Happy blogging! :rocket:
